## Pre-steps
1. Install a ChromeDriver from right here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
2. Remember where you saved the ChromeDriver.
3. You should also have Google Chrome installed.
4. You will see the line that starts with "with Chrome(executable_path" in the thrid cell from the attached Python code file. Copy and paste the path where your ChromeDriver was saved. (I saved mine in C:\Program Files. if you did the same, you won't have to change the code I wrote)
5. After running the required libraries and function cells, go to the bottom of the page.
6. Input the url and the desired number of comments you would like to scrape.
7. Run the last cell and "ScrapedYoutubeComment.csv" file will be created & saved!
